## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-    View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
-    See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-    Create, read, update, and delete product feedback requests
-    Receive form validations when trying to create/edit feedback requests
-    Sort suggestions by most/least upvotes and most/least comments
-    Filter suggestions by category
-    Add comments and replies to a product feedback request
-    Upvote product feedback requests
-    **Bonus**: Keep track of any changes, even after refreshing the browser (`localStorage` could be used for this if you're not building out a full-stack app)
